# LEGOCharacterCreator
An Unreal Engine 5 project that allows you to make your own custom character just like the classic Lego games

# To use

Since these are project files and not an exe, you will need Unreal Engine 5.0.3+, as well as the colour wheel addon found here: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/simple-color-wheel 

Open the uproject file and click play. The icons that look like pieces can be used to change the colour, options are: 

- Colour Wheel
- HEX value 
- RGB text input 

The arrows next to each piece will change either the body part or the texture depending on which is selected (e.g. selecting an arrow on the hair will give the character some hair or a helmet but selecting the arrows on the torso will change the texture)

There are also some parts that I didn't add colour changing for, it's quite tedious to do it for each one for each different type of input.
